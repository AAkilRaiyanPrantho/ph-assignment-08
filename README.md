# Donation Campaign
Live Link: https://tourmaline-eclair-64dbcc.netlify.app/

This project is based on a Donation based website. Some of the features of this site are -

=> In the Home page we got a Banner section in which there is a NavBar where there is a simple logo of the site and also three route options of Home, Donations, Statistics. Each representing a different route and linked to their individual route pages.
=> Below the Header section,there are four categories and a total of twelve donation options.
=> Each donation option is represented in a Card.
=> Clicking on each card takes the Donor to the Details route of that specific card.
=> In the details route, Donor can get to know about that donation cause in details and gets a chance to donate by clicking the Donate Now button
=> All of the donations done by the donor can be seen in the Donations route.
=> And finally there is a Statistics route, where one can see how many donations he has made in those twelve donation options and presented it in a Pie Chart.
